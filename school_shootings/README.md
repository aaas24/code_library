Gun violence in the United States goes beyond school shootings, but the defenseless of young kids, in environments that are meant to keep them safe takes this situation beyond any norm. As a mother and a citizen, I worry of the gun violence in the United States. Given my skills in data analytics, I gravitated towards trying to make sense of this senseless violence, in the hope to have better discussions and, hopefully, share some light into this issue.
