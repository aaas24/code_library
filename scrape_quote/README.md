## DESCRIPTION

This project is a step by step of several attempts to master webscraping. Given that the practices is not always ethical, I have limited the studies to websites that either allow the practice in their robot.txt web file or that allow the practice, like: http://toscrape.com

The particular project defined here uses the Quotes website of http://toscrape.com as a baseline

This project is based off the book "Web Scraping with Python: Collecting Data from the Modern Web" [1]
